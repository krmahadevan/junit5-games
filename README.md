# junit5-games

As part of my effort to figure out various concepts of microservices, I realised that majority of the samples on the internet that deal with explaining different aspects of Microservices, all are based on JUnit5.

Thanks to my decade old association with TestNG, I never had the need to explore JUnit.

This repository is my effort to just capture my learnings of JUnit5 capabilities as an end-user so that I can start understanding the samples on the internet for microservices.

This repository can be used as a reference repository if you would like to understand various aspects of JUnit5.

Now that I think of it, I think I should perhaps create one for TestNG too.
